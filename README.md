# Patcher
This tool will help you patch your **main.dol** files (which contains contents of the original servers) and replace the original servers with DanceParty ones.

You will need to install Python 3 to run this script, after you do so, double click to run it or open it through CLI `python patcher.py` and it will open up a GUI where you have to select the DOL file you extracted from your game.

### What is a DOL file and where can I find it?
DOL files contain game's source code and by patching it with our tool it replaces old server URLs with ours which builds a connection between you and the servers.

You can extract the DOL file by dumping the files of your **legally** owned game. You can find it in `DATA/sys` folder.
